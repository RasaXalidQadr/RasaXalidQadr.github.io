# Fixing the Sass Dependency Issue

## Problem
VuePress is complaining about missing `sass-embedded` dependency which is required for processing SCSS files in the default theme.

## Quick Solution

### Option 1: Install the missing dependency manually

1. Open Command Prompt or PowerShell as Administrator
2. Navigate to your project directory:
   ```cmd
   cd "C:\Users\ichom\my-portfolio"
   ```
3. Install the sass dependency:
   ```cmd
   npm install sass --save-dev
   ```
4. Start the development server:
   ```cmd
   npm run docs:dev
   ```

### Option 2: Use a simpler configuration

If the sass installation doesn't work, you can modify the VuePress config to avoid SCSS processing:

1. Open `docs\.vuepress\config.js`
2. Replace the bundler configuration with:
   ```javascript
   bundler: viteBundler({
     viteOptions: {
       css: {
         preprocessorOptions: {}
       }
     }
   }),
   ```

### Option 3: Clean install (Recommended)

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder and `package-lock.json` file
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Run: `npm install sass --save-dev` 
4. Run: `npm run docs:dev`

## Commands to Run

Open Command Prompt and run these commands one by one:

```cmd
cd "C:\Users\ichom\my-portfolio"
rmdir /s /q node_modules
del package-lock.json
npm install
npm install sass --save-dev
npm run docs:dev
```

After this, your VuePress portfolio should work correctly at `http://localhost:8080/my-portfolio/` or another port if 8080 is busy.

## Alternative: Create from scratch with proper setup

If the above doesn't work, you can create a fresh VuePress project:

```cmd
npm create vuepress-site my-new-portfolio
cd my-new-portfolio
npm install
npm install sass --save-dev
npm run dev
```

The issue is simply that VuePress's default theme uses SCSS for styling, and we need the `sass` package to process those files. Once installed, everything should work smoothly.
